# api-personal-project

Summary:

This project is my first personal project. I will be creating a script in
python that utilizes APIs to gather information on the non-profit company
'OpenAI'. The script will send useful information to my email with updates
on the status of the company going public.

Skills to be Demonstrated:

- Collecting useful data in python from various websites using the help of APIs
- Having the data being sent to an email address entered by the user (myself)
- The creation and cloning of a Github repository onto my local machine
- Using Git to manage changes, workflow, and documentation of my project
- Using the linux-based terminal to navigate, create, and order different files and directories based on the requirements for the project
- Project Management throughout the lifecycle of the project through the use of GitHub's Project Management tool
